Unity IL2CPP Game Analysis Report
=====================================

Game Type: Unity IL2CPP Compiled Game
Analysis Date: 2026-02-24

OVERVIEW
--------
This is a Unity mobile game that uses IL2CPP compilation technology.
The original C# source code has been converted to C++ and compiled into native libraries.
However, we can extract significant information from the global-metadata.dat file.

KEY FINDINGS
------------

1. GAME SCRIPTS FOUND (2,215 total):
   - CFXR_Demo.cs - Cartoon FX Remaster demo scripts
   - CFXR_Effect.cs - Main effect system
   - CFXR_ParticleText.cs - Particle text rendering
   - ETFXButtonScript.cs - UI button interactions
   - ETFXSceneManager.cs - Scene management
   - UICanvasManager.cs - UI canvas management
   - PEButtonScript.cs - Button effects

2. MAJOR SYSTEMS:
   - Cartoon FX Remaster (CFXR) - Particle effects system
   - Google Play Games integration
   - UI Management system
   - Scene management
   - Input management (CwInputManager)

3. UNITY COMPONENTS (2,793):
   - MonoBehaviour components
   - UI components
   - Event system components
   - Material management

4. MANAGER CLASSES (5,945):
   - Input managers
   - Scene managers
   - UI canvas managers
   - Resource managers
   - Material managers

5. UI ELEMENTS (26,532):

   - Enemy objects (MEnemyObj.cs)
   - Level up popup (LevelUpPopup.cs)
   - Character systems
   - Score systems

TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------
- Total strings extracted: 597,683
- Unity version appears to be recent (based on component names)
- Uses IL2CPP compilation (C# -> C++ conversion)
- Includes Google Play Games services
- Has extensive particle effects system (Cartoon FX Remaster)
- Contains UI management and scene management systems

GAME GENRE INDICATORS
---------------------
Based on the extracted class names and systems:
- Likely a casual mobile game
- Has particle effects (suggests visual-heavy gameplay)
- Includes Google Play Games integration (multiplayer/leaderboards)
- Has enemy objects (suggests some form of combat/action)
- Has level up system (RPG or progression elements)
- Extensive UI system (menu-heavy game)

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SOURCE CODE RECOVERY
----------------------------------------
To get the actual C# source code, you would need:

1. The libil2cpp.so file (native library) - currently missing from this extraction
2. Use Il2CppDumper tool with:
   - Input: libil2cpp.so + global-metadata.dat
   - Output: Reconstructed C# code

Alternative approaches:
- Use Il2CppInspector tool
- Use specialized Unity decompilers
- Look for the complete APK with native libraries

CONCLUSION
----------
While we cannot extract the complete C# source code without the native library files,
we have successfully identified the game's structure, main systems, and likely gameplay elements.
This appears to be a Unity mobile game with extensive particle effects, UI systems, and
Google Play Games integration.
